## ⚙️ Configuration

### 1. Connection
1. Launch the app and open **Settings**.
2. Select **Connection Type**: Hyperion, WLED, or Adalight.
3. Enter the IP/Port (for network controllers) or configure USB settings.

### 2. LED Configuration
- **Per-Side LED Configuration**: You can configure each side separately:
    - Top: 60 LEDs (default)
    - Right: 34 LEDs (default)
    - Bottom: 60 LEDs (default)
    - Left: 34 LEDs (default)
- **LED Layout**: Configure starting corner, direction (clockwise/counterclockwise), and enable/disable individual sides.

### 3. Capture Settings
- **Capture Source**: Choose between **Screen** (default) or **Camera** mode.
    - *Screen*: Standard screen capture using MediaProjection API (requires screen capture permission).
    - *Camera*: Alternative method using device camera with perspective correction. Ideal for TVs that don't support screen capture or for external phone setups.
- **Capture Rate (FPS)**: Default 30 FPS (options: 10, 15, 24, 30, 60).
- **Capture Quality**:
    - *Low (64px)* — For low-end devices or to reduce latency.
    - *Medium (128px)* — Balanced (Default, Recommended).
    - *High (256px)* — For powerful devices only.
    - *Ultra (512px)* — Maximum quality for high-end devices.
- **Send Average Color**: Enable for maximum performance (sends a single color for the whole strip).

### 3.1. Camera Mode Setup
When using **Camera** as the capture source:
1. Grant **Camera** permission when prompted.
2. Open **Settings** → **Camera Corner Setup**.
3. Position your device so the camera can see the TV screen.
4. Drag the four corner markers (TL, TR, BR, BL) to match the edges of your TV screen.
5. Tap **Save** to store the corner positions.
6. The app will use these corners for perspective correction during capture.

**Tips:**
- Use the live preview on the main screen to calibrate your device position before starting capture.
- Ensure good lighting so the camera can clearly see the TV screen.
- The corner adjustment helps compensate for non-square camera placement relative to the TV.

### 4. Smoothing
- **Enable Smoothing**: Enabled by default. Reduces LED flickering.
- **Preset**: "Balanced" (default). Options: Off, Responsive, Balanced, Smooth.
- **Settling Time**: 200 ms (default, range: 50-500 ms).
- **Output Delay**: 2 frames (default, range: 0-10).
- **Update Frequency**: 25 Hz (default, options: 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60 Hz).

### 5. Launch
1. Grant **Screen Capture / Casting** permission when prompted.
2. Toggle the button to start the grabber.

##### Arduino Sketch for Adalight

A ready-to-use Arduino sketch compatible with the app is available in [`adalight-sketch.ino`](adalight-sketch/adalight-sketch.ino).

**Quick Start:**

1. **Install FastLED library:**
    - In Arduino IDE: `Tools` → `Manage Libraries` → search for "FastLED" → install

2. **Configure the sketch:**
    - Open `adalight-sketch/adalight-sketch.ino`
    - Modify constants at the top of the file:
        - `DATA_PIN` — pin for LED strip connection (default 6)
        - `NUM_LEDS` — number of LEDs in the strip (must match app settings!)
        - `LED_TYPE` — LED strip type (WS2812B, WS2811, SK6812, etc.)
        - `COLOR_ORDER` — color order (GRB for WS2812B, RGB for others)
        - `BRIGHTNESS` — brightness (0-255)

3. **Wiring:**
    - LED strip DATA → Arduino pin (default 6)
    - LED strip VCC → 5V Arduino (or external power supply for long strips)
    - LED strip GND → GND Arduino
    - ⚠️ **Important:** For long strips (>10 leds), use an external 5V power supply!

4. **Upload sketch:**
    - Connect Arduino to computer via USB
    - Select board and port in Arduino IDE
    - Upload the sketch

5. **Connect to Android:**
    - Disconnect Arduino from computer
    - Connect Arduino to Android device via USB OTG cable
    - In the app, select connection type: **Adalight**
    - Set Baud Rate: **115200**
    - Select protocol: **ADA**
    - Ensure LED count in the app matches `NUM_LEDS` in the sketch

**WS2812B Wiring Example:**
```
WS2812B DATA → Pin 6 Arduino
WS2812B VCC  → 5V Arduino (or external 5V)
WS2812B GND  → GND Arduino
```

**For other LED types:**
- **APA102 (SPI)**: Use FastLED library with `APA102` configuration and **LBAPA** protocol in the app
- **WS2811**: Similar to WS2812B, usually `COLOR_ORDER = RGB`
- **SK6812**: Similar to WS2812B, usually `COLOR_ORDER = GRB`

**Troubleshooting:**
- If LEDs don't light up: check wiring, ensure `NUM_LEDS` matches in sketch and app
- If colors are wrong: change `COLOR_ORDER` (try RGB, GRB, BRG)
- If no data received: check Baud Rate (should be 115200), ensure USB OTG cable supports data transfer

## 📱 Android TV Features
This application is fully optimized for Android TV, including support for the Leanback Launcher and D-pad navigation. For easier text entry (IP addresses), we recommend using the "Google TV" or "Android TV Remote" app on your phone.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### TCL TV Users
On TCL devices, aggressive system battery optimization may kill background services.
**Solution:**
1. Go to **Settings > Apps > Special App Access > Auto-Start**.
2. Enable Auto-Start for Universal Ambient Light.
3. Alternatively, check the "Safety Guard" app and add the app to exceptions.

### High-Quality Video Playback (4K/HDR)
Playback issues with high-quality video (2K/4K/HDR) while the ambient light is active are a hardware limitation of many TVs. Built-in processors often cannot handle simultaneous heavy video decoding and screen capturing. This is a deep-seated issue that is rarely fixable via software.

**If you experience video stuttering or lag:**
1. Lower the video playback quality to 1080p or 720p (depending on your TV's capabilities).
2. Or completely disable the ambient light application while watching high-resolution content.
3. You can try adjusting capture quality and FPS settings, but it is unlikely to fully solve the issue.

### DRM-Protected Content
**DRM-protected applications** (such as Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, Кинопоиск, and similar streaming services) **will not work** with screen capture mode due to Android's security restrictions. This is a fundamental limitation of the Android MediaProjection API and cannot be bypassed.

**Why this happens:**
- Android blocks screen capture of DRM-protected content to prevent piracy.
- This is enforced at the system level and cannot be overridden by applications.

**Solutions:**
1. **Use Camera Mode**: Switch to **Camera** capture source in settings. This method uses the device camera instead of screen capture, so it works with DRM-protected content. You'll need to position a phone/tablet with the camera facing the TV screen.
2. **Disable Ambient Light**: Turn off the ambient light feature while watching DRM-protected content.
3. **Use Non-DRM Sources**: Watch content from sources that don't use DRM protection (local files, YouTube, etc.).

**Note:** Camera mode requires proper calibration of corner positions for accurate color capture.
